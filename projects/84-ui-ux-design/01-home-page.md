## Project 01 — Home page

The Explorer's front door. Sets the tone, surfaces scale, gives both first-timers and returning
users a fast path forward.

## TL;DR

Replace the current placeholder home (two cards on a vast empty canvas) with a layout that mirrors
opentelemetry.io's home structure: a `td-cover-block` hero with global search, the OTel-purple stats
band using canonical numbers ("12+ · 200+ · 1005+ · 102+"), an ecosystems grid, a "browse by signal"
section (Traces · Metrics · Logs · Baggage), and a "recent activity" rail.

## Goal

In five seconds a visitor should be able to answer:

1. What is this site?
2. How big is the dataset?
3. Where do I go next (search, ecosystem, signal)?

A returning user should land directly on the ⌘K search or the recent activity feed.

## Scope (in)

- **Hero (cover-block)**: dark-overlay background with radial gradient + grid pattern, animated
  `<Compass>` visual (the OtelLogo already lives in the navbar — no need to repeat the brand mark),
  gradient headline ("OpenTelemetry **Ecosystem Explorer**"), short description, primary CTA
  (`btn-lg` orange), secondary CTA (outline-light "Read overview").
- **Global search**: glass-effect ⌘K-able input below the hero; placeholder hints ("Search 1,005+
  components, instrumentations, vendors…"); chip suggestions below.
- **Stats band** (`box-primary`, OTel purple): four counters fed from a single source synced with
  opentelemetry.io's canonical numbers.
- **Ecosystems grid**: Collector and Java Agent as primary cards (with stability pill, count, latest
  version, "updated this week"), plus dashed "coming soon" cards for Python · Go · JS · .NET.
- **Browse by signal**: four cards (Traces · Metrics · Logs · Baggage) — note **Baggage**, matching
  opentelemetry.io's signal taxonomy. Not "Profiles".
- **Recent activity rail**: list of the last ~10 events (component
  added/promoted/deprecated/changed) with status pill, ecosystem label, version, and timestamp. Each
  row links to the relevant detail page.
- **CNCF callout** + **footer** (provided by the foundation layer).

## Out of scope

- ~~The actual search backend — wire to a stub that returns canned results, or fall back to
  client-side filtering across a static index. A real search engine is a follow-up.~~ **Resolved
  2026-05-25:** the cross-ecosystem engine (page registry + Collector index + Java Agent
  instrumentations) shipped in PR 2. See the Follow-ups section for the remaining Java Agent index
  endpoint work.
- Live ingestion of the "recent activity" feed — rely on a periodically-built JSON for v1. (PR 6
  ships a static stub `public/data/activity/feed.json`; the generated pipeline is in the Follow-ups
  section below.)
- Personalization (e.g., "your favorites").
- Multi-language localization beyond reuse of foundation language dropdown.

## Dependencies

- **Project 00 — Foundation** (theme system, NavBar, Footer, CncfCallout, StatusPill, Card
  primitive).

## Tasks

1. **Hero/CoverBlock component** — reusable across home and ecosystem landing. Props: title,
   subtitle, CTAs, optional right-side content slot.
2. **GlobalSearch component** — controlled input with ⌘K shortcut binding, suggestion chips, results
   dropdown (initially stubbed). Persist last-used query in `sessionStorage`.
3. **StatsBand component** — four-column grid; numbers and labels driven by a config file. Land that
   file with the canonical numbers and a comment pointing to the opentelemetry.io page that
   publishes them. Keep the file small so future updates are a one-liner.
4. **EcosystemsGrid component** — accepts an ordered list of ecosystems with metadata (icon, name,
   stability, count, latest version, weekly delta). Two prominent + four "coming soon" placeholders
   for v1.
5. **SignalsRow component** — four signal cards. Use the `Traces · Metrics · Logs · Baggage` set to
   match opentelemetry.io. Each links to a future cross-ecosystem signal-filter URL (placeholder OK
   for v1).
6. **RecentActivityRail component** — consumes a `GET /activity.json` (or similar) feed. Group by
   recency (last 7 / last 30 days). Each row is a link to a detail page.
7. **Home route** — composes the above in order: hero → search → stats → ecosystems → signals +
   activity → CNCF callout.
8. **Empty / loading states** for the recent-activity feed (foundation has the empty-state pattern).
   **Shipped: PR 6 (#555)** — `RecentActivityRail` renders loading (`role="status" aria-live`),
   empty, and error states off `useActivityFeed`'s `DataState`; loading + error covered by tests.
9. **Tests** — visual regression on hero + stats; unit tests on ⌘K binding; integration test that
   clicking a stat link goes to the right route. **Mostly shipped:** the `/_dev/components` showcase
   captures all six home components (visual-regression baseline updates on merge via
   `screenshots-baseline.yml`), and `global-search.test.tsx` covers the ⌘K/Ctrl+K binding. **Still
   open:** the StatsBand stat-link routing integration test — tracked as the lone remaining #371
   item (small follow-up PR).

### PR 1 — implementation notes (locked 2026-05-19)

PR 1 ships the `<CoverBlock>` primitive, a `<HomeV1 />` shell that composes CoverBlock plus
skeleton-box placeholders for the four sections PRs 2-6 will fill, and the `/` route swap in
`V1App.tsx`. Branch: `feat/84-phase2-pr1-cover-block`, off current `main` (post-#487). Re-derives
from `feat/84-tmp-full-layout` rather than cherry-picking the bundled commit.

Locked decisions (per the 2026-05-19 grilling session — full rationale in
[`NEXT-STEPS.md`](./NEXT-STEPS.md) decision log):

#### Component shape

- `<CoverBlock>` is reusable across home and Phase 3 ecosystem-landing. Props: `logo`, `eyebrow`,
  `title`, `lead`, `ctas`, `aside`, `children`, `headingId`, `className`. `<HomeV1 />` mounts one
  CoverBlock with home-specific content + skeletons for the four sections below.
- Hero visual: animated `<Compass>` from `@/components/icons/compass` in the `logo` slot — the
  OtelLogo already lives in the navbar, so the hero uses the compass for visual interest instead of
  repeating the brand mark. Cover-block locally pins `--hero-accent-hsl` to `var(--otel-orange-hsl)`
  (and `--hero-accent-alt-hsl` to blue) so the compass stays orange-dominant in both themes (the
  global hero-accent tokens flip per theme; the cover-block is always orange-dominant by design).
- CTAs locked verbatim: primary `"Browse components"` → `/collector`; secondary
  `"Read the overview"` → `https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/` with
  `target="_blank"` `rel="noopener"`.
- Title gradient via `background-clip: text` on `.td-cover-block__title-accent`, running
  `--otel-blue-hsl` → `--otel-orange-hsl` directly (cover-block is always dark; the theme-flipping
  `--hero-accent-*` aliases would invert the gradient pointlessly).

#### Background visual

- Full opentelemetry.io-style hero treatment: linear gradient base (`--cover-block-bg-from-hsl` →
  `--cover-block-bg-to-hsl`) + two radial glows (orange + purple via `--otel-orange-hsl` /
  `--otel-purple-hsl`) + inline-SVG grid-pattern overlay. All pure CSS, no asset dependency. Closes
  the open question on hero background image (struck below).

#### Placeholders

- Skeleton-box treatment for the four PR 2-6 slots inside `<HomeV1 />` (aria-labels:
  `"Ecosystem statistics"`, `"Featured ecosystems"`, `"Browse by signal"`, `"Recent activity"` -
  human-readable for screen readers; the matching modifier classes use slug forms `--stats`,
  `--ecosystems`, `--signals`, `--recent-activity`) and for the `<GlobalSearch>` slot inside
  CoverBlock.
- Skeleton-everywhere is the locked default for PR-staged placeholders across this redesign — gives
  reviewers a non-broken preview.

#### CSS file scope

- Three new partials added in PR 1: `src/v1/styles/cover-block.css` (reusable hero rules),
  `src/v1/styles/buttons.css` (the `.td-btn` primitive used by CoverBlock CTAs and future
  consumers), and `src/v1/styles/home.css` (HomeV1 wrapper + skeleton rules). All three `@import`-ed
  into `src/v1/styles/index.css`. PRs 2-6 grow `home.css` as real components replace skeletons.

#### Token consolidation (the "concise and in-sync" sweep)

- Add `--otel-purple-hsl: 230 38% 49%` to `src/styles/tokens.css` as a primitive alongside the
  existing `--otel-blue-hsl` / `--otel-orange-hsl`.
- Refactor `src/v1/styles/cncf-callout.css` line 28: hardcoded `#4f62ad` →
  `hsl(var(--otel-purple-hsl))`.
- New `--stats-band-bg-hsl` references `var(--otel-purple-hsl)` rather than duplicating the raw HSL
  value.
- CoverBlock self-scopes dark via `--cover-block-*` tokens (not `--background-hsl`). Light-theme
  `.v1-app` override block explicitly **redeclares** all `--cover-block-*` and `--stats-band-*`
  tokens with the same values as the dark block — symmetric contract, no implicit fallthrough.

#### Route swap

- `V1App.tsx` route table flips `/` from legacy `<HomePage />` to `<HomeV1 />`. Production unchanged
  (`V1_REDESIGN` off on main branch deploys); v1 preview shows hero + 4 skeletons.

#### Showcase, tests, and baseline

- `/_dev/components` (from #487) gets two `<CoverBlock>` variants: title-only and title+aside
  (exercises the `aside` slot used by Phase 3 ecosystem-landing). `<HomeV1 />` not added to showcase
  — covered by real `/` snapshot.
- Test coverage hybrid: full semantic assertions on `<CoverBlock>` (h1, `aria-labelledby`, slot
  rendering, modifier classes, `className` passthrough); structural assertions on `<HomeV1 />`
  (composition + skeleton order + aria-labels).
- Visual-regression baseline updates automatically on merge via `screenshots-baseline.yml`. PR
  description calls out expected diffs at `/` (route swap) and `/_dev/components` (CoverBlock
  added). CI gating behaviour on over-budget diffs verified during implementation; threshold tuned
  if needed.

## Acceptance criteria

- Above-the-fold (hero + search) is fully usable with no scroll on a 1280×800 viewport.
- ⌘K (or Ctrl+K on non-Mac) focuses the global search.
- Stats band reads exactly: `12+ Languages`, `200+ Collector Components`, `1005+ Integrations`,
  `102+ Vendors` (or whatever the canonical config says — verifiable against opentelemetry.io).
- Light and dark themes both pass contrast in every section.
- Clicking a signal card navigates to the right cross-ecosystem filter URL (even if the destination
  page is a placeholder for v1).
- Clicking a stat number navigates to the relevant doc (`12+` → languages page, `200+` → collector
  components list, etc.).
- "Coming soon" ecosystem cards render but are not links (or are links to a join-the-effort page).

## Open questions

- ~~Does the global search actually search across ecosystems, or just narrow within the current
  one?~~ **Answered 2026-05-25:** cross-ecosystem. PR 2's engine indexes pages, Java Agent
  instrumentations, and Collector components in one shared `SearchResult[]`.
- ~~Is there an existing `activity.json` or similar in `ecosystem-automation`, or do we need to
  generate one as part of this project?~~ **Partially answered:** no existing pipeline. PR 6 ships a
  static stub (`public/data/activity/feed.json`) so the rail renders the populated state; the real
  registry-diff pipeline is tracked in the Follow-ups section.

## Follow-ups (deferred to separate issues / later phases)

Tracked here so the work stays visible after #371 closes and through the end-of-redesign cleanup.
None of these block closing the Phase 2 issue.

- **Java Agent index endpoint (`/data/javaagent/index.json`).** PR 2's engine currently calls
  `loadAllInstrumentations(latest)` for Java Agent, which fans out to one fetch per instrumentation
  (~1000 requests on first GlobalSearch open). Mirror the Collector pattern by emitting a flat
  `index.json` from `ecosystem-automation` with `id / name / display_name / description / features`;
  then the engine swaps to a single `loadIndex()` call (same shape as the Collector side already
  does). Flagged by Copilot on PR 2; no existing issue. Scope: `ecosystem-automation` watcher work +
  a small `src/lib/api/javaagent-data.ts` addition + a swap in `src/lib/search.ts`.
- **Real recent-activity feed pipeline.** PR 6 ships `public/data/activity/feed.json` as a static
  5-entry stub. The generated version should be derived from registry diffs (component added /
  promoted / deprecated / changed) in `ecosystem-automation`, with the same JSON shape the rail
  already consumes. Scope: watcher work; no client-side changes once the file is generated.
- **"See all results" page for GlobalSearch overflow.** PR 2 caps the dropdown to 10 results with a
  `Showing N of M matches` footer that's currently informational only. A future surface (likely
  under `/search?q=...` or folded into Phase 4's list page, which already has faceted filters)
  should let users browse beyond the cap. Scope: new route in `V1App`, reuses the engine in
  `src/lib/search.ts` unchanged.
