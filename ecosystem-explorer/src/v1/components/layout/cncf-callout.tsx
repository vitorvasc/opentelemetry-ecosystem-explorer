/*
 * CncfCallout — explorer-original chrome that sits above FooterV1 on every
 * v1 route. No upstream opentelemetry.io equivalent (grep'd: zero hits in
 * `layouts/_partials/` or `themes/docsy/`). Content follows the redesign
 * brief (`projects/84-ui-ux-design/ecosystem-explorer-v1-design-brief.md`
 * lines 55, 82) and the mockup at `ecosystem-explorer-v1-mockups.html:1738`.
 *
 * Surface uses OTel-secondary (purple) per the brief — `td-box--secondary` —
 * which the design brief identifies as the canonical sitewide-callout color.
 * The mockup uses a neutral `box-muted`; the brief is the more recent intent.
