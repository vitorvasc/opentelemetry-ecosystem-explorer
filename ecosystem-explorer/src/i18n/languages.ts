 * Single source of truth for the locales and namespaces the app ships.
 * This module is intentionally side-effect free (no i18n.init()), so UI and
 * tests can import the lists without pulling in the runtime backend.
 *
 * Adding a language: append an entry to LANGUAGES and drop the matching
 * public/locales/<code>/ files. The init config and the navbar switcher both
 * derive from here, so the supported set and the switcher options never drift.
