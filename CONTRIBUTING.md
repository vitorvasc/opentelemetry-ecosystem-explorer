# Contributing to OpenTelemetry Ecosystem Explorer

Welcome to the OpenTelemetry Ecosystem Explorer! Whether you're fixing a typo, reporting a bug, or
proposing a new feature, every contribution helps.

This project helps users discover and explore OpenTelemetry projects, instrumentations, and
components across the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) ecosystem.

**No contribution is too small!** We value all forms of participation, from documentation
improvements to code contributions. If you're new to open source or OpenTelemetry, don't hesitate to
ask questions.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/opentelemetry-ecosystem-explorer.git
cd opentelemetry-ecosystem-explorer
uv sync --all-groups && bun install
cd ecosystem-explorer && bun install && bun run serve
# Visit http://localhost:5173
```

Now you can browse Java Agent instrumentations and Collector components locally. Continue reading
for detailed setup and contribution guidelines.

## Mapping The Ecosystem

Building the registry, automation pipelines, and Explorer interface is only part of the work. Before
systems can be automated, the terrain must first be mapped.

Each project within the ecosystem represents its own landscape with distinct components, structures,
and conventions. Our task is to survey these landscapes and determine:

- What components exist?
- What metadata is available?
- Is that metadata structured in a way that can be incorporated into the registry?
- Where are the gaps?

In many cases, this requires careful exploration like reading source code, locating configuration
files, identifying implicit conventions, and translating them into structured, registry-ready data.
Even existing data should be regularly reviewed and iterated upon.

If you are interested in a particular language, auto-instrumentation tool, or corner of the
ecosystem, we would love your help.

Choose an area that interests you and begin the survey. Trace the components, locate data, identify
patterns, and document what you find. If something is unclear or incomplete, open an issue or start
a discussion, expedition logs are part of the process. We can help validate findings, refine
translation strategies, and support integration into the registry.

This work is valuable for both newcomers and seasoned contributors. For those new to the community,
it provides a structured way to understand how projects are organized, how metadata is shaped, and
how automation connects systems together. For experienced contributors, it offers a broader,
cross-ecosystem perspective, revealing patterns, inconsistencies, and opportunities for improvement
that are often invisible when focused on a single project.

Whether you are surveying your first repository or helping refine automation across dozens, every
mapped component strengthens the atlas.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin contributing, ensure you have the following tools installed:

### Required Tools

- **Python 3.11 or higher**: The project is built with Python and requires version 3.11+
  - Check your version: `python --version` or `python3 --version`
  - Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- **uv**: Fast Python package installer and resolver
  - Install with: `pip install uv` or follow
    [uv installation guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

- **Bun**: JavaScript runtime and package manager (used for ecosystem-explorer and markdown linting)
  - Check your version: `bun --version`
  - Install from [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/)

- **Git**: Version control system (used in some of the automation scripts)
  - Check your version: `git --version`
  - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)

### Optional but Recommended

- **pre-commit**: Git hook framework for running checks before commits
  - Installed automatically with development dependencies
  - Helps catch issues before they're committed

## Getting Started

### Fork and Clone the Repository

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub first, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/opentelemetry-ecosystem-explorer.git
cd opentelemetry-ecosystem-explorer
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Python dependencies using uv
uv sync --all-groups

# Install JavaScript dependencies for markdown linting (from repo root)
bun install

# Install ecosystem-explorer dependencies
cd ecosystem-explorer && bun install && cd ..

# Set up pre-commit hooks (recommended)
pre-commit install
```

### Create a Branch

Before making changes, create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
```

## Local Development

### Project Structure

This repository contains three components:

- **ecosystem-registry**: Raw data registry
- **ecosystem-automation**: Automation pipelines
- **ecosystem-explorer**: Web application

Reference implementations: [collector-watcher](https://github.com/jaydeluca/collector-watcher),
[instrumentation-explorer](https://github.com/jaydeluca/instrumentation-explorer)

### Running Code Quality Checks

Before committing changes, run these checks to ensure your code will pass our CI pipeline:

```bash
# Run all linting (Markdown, ESLint, Ruff)
bun run lint

# Run all formatting (Prettier, Ruff)
bun run format
uv run ruff format .

# Run markdown linting specifically
bun run lint:md

# Fix issues automatically
bun run format
bun run lint:md:fix
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Add copyright headers to new files
uv run python scripts/add_copyright.py

# Check copyright headers
uv run python scripts/check_copyright.py
```

If you installed pre-commit hooks, these checks will run automatically when you commit.

## Testing

The Python modules in this project use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run tests with coverage report
uv run pytest --cov

# Run tests for a specific component
cd ecosystem-automation/collector-watcher
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run a specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_specific.py

# Run tests matching a pattern
uv run pytest -k "test_pattern"
```

### Test Organization

#### Python Tests

- Test files follow the naming convention: `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`
- Tests are located in `ecosystem-automation/` subdirectories
- Each component has its own test suite

#### JavaScript Tests

- Test files follow the naming convention: `*.test.tsx` or `*.test.ts`
- Tests are located alongside the components they test in the `src/` directory
- Test setup file at `src/test/setup.ts` imports jest-dom matchers

## PR Screenshots

When working on UI changes, you can automatically generate screenshots of key Explorer pages to
include in your PR for visual review.

### Automatic Screenshots via GitHub Actions

Add the `add-screenshots` label to your PR. A GitHub Actions workflow will:

1. Build the frontend
2. Launch a local server and use Playwright to capture screenshots of key pages (home,
   instrumentation list, and instrumentation detail tabs)
3. Commit the screenshots to `ecosystem-explorer/screenshots/` on your PR branch

The workflow re-runs automatically on new commits while the label is present.

### Local Screenshots

You can also generate screenshots locally:

```bash
cd ecosystem-explorer
bun install
bun run build
bunx playwright install --with-deps chromium
node scripts/take-screenshots.mjs
# Screenshots are saved to ecosystem-explorer/screenshots/
```

## Contributing Rules

### Feature Proposals

Before implementing significant new features:

1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ecosystem-explorer/issues/new) to
   discuss your idea
2. Explain the use case and proposed approach
3. Get feedback from maintainers
4. Proceed with implementation once there's consensus

This helps avoid wasted effort on features that may not align with project goals.
