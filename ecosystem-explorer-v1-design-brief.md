# v1 design proposal — Ecosystem Explorer

> Brainstorm for [#84 — \[Explorer\] UI/UX Design](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ecosystem-explorer/issues/84). Builds on `DESIGN.md` and **aligns the explorer to the existing visual language of [opentelemetry.io](https://opentelemetry.io)**. Mockup HTML is included alongside this doc as `ecosystem-explorer-v1-mockups.html` — it's a static prototype with a tab switcher across all four page types and a working light/dark theme toggle.

---

## TL;DR

The placeholder design felt like a separate microsite rather than part of the OTel project. **The fix is alignment, not redesign.** This proposal standardizes the explorer on the same visual grammar as opentelemetry.io: same dark navbar, same light/dark theme toggle, same OTel purple `#4f62ad` and orange `#f5a800`, same Bootstrap-flavored chrome (Docsy `td-*` patterns), same footer, same CNCF callout, same canonical stats numbers ("12+ Languages · 200+ Collector Components · 1005+ Integrations · 102+ Vendors").

On top of that shared scaffold, the explorer adds the things opentelemetry.io can't: real faceted filtering with URL state, a three-pane component detail page with version timeline + diff, density toggles (Cards / Compact / Table), and pipeline-anatomy diagrams.

A user clicking from `opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/` to the Explorer should not feel they have left the site.

## Why alignment first

The previous iteration of this brief proposed a strong direction ("The Catalog") with thoughtful IA. What it didn't do was **lock the visual language to what opentelemetry.io already publishes**. Once you put the two side by side, the gap is obvious:

| Element | opentelemetry.io | v0 placeholder | v1 (this proposal) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Theme support | Light + Dark + Auto (toggle in navbar, persisted to `td-color-theme` in `localStorage`) | Dark-only | **Light + Dark + Auto** (same key, same toggle) |
| Brand purple | `#4f62ad` (theme-color, mask-icon, primary stats band) | Not used | **`#4f62ad` adopted as `--color-secondary`** |
| Brand orange | `#f5a800` (logo gradient, kapa accent) | `38 95% 52%` HSL ≈ `#f5a800` | Already aligned ✓ |
| Topnav | Always-dark `td-navbar`: Docs · Ecosystem · Status · Community · Training · Blog · search · lang · theme | Custom 2-link bar | **Mirror full structure**, add Explorer entry |
| Stats numbers | "12+ · 200+ · 1005+ · 102+" | Made up our own | **Match canonical numbers** |
| Signals | Traces · Metrics · Logs · **Baggage** | Had Profiles | **Switch to Baggage** |
| Footer | Two clusters of Font Awesome social icons + centered copyright | Custom | **Mirror Docsy footer** |
| Hero | `td-cover-block` with bg image + dark overlay + centered content + `btn-lg btn-primary/btn-secondary` | Generic gradient | **Use cover-block** |
| CNCF callout | On every page (`td-box--secondary`) | Missing | **Add to every page** |
| Component pattern | Bootstrap `.card` with `border-success` etc. + `text-bg-*` badges | Custom | **Adopt** + extend with type stripe |
| Theme tokens | `data-bs-theme` attribute | Tailwind v4 only | **`data-bs-theme` honored alongside Tailwind** |

This is now reflected in the updated `DESIGN.md` ("Alignment with opentelemetry.io" section) and visible in the mockup.

## What's working in v0 that we keep

- The OTel orange (`#f5a800`) was already aligned — kept as `--color-primary`
- The card hover state (subtle scale + shadow) feels right and translates cleanly into Bootstrap card patterns
- The gradient text treatment for hero headlines is a nice signature element worth keeping (now using `purple → orange` to match the OTel logo)
- The grid-pattern background overlay for hero sections is a low-cost depth cue worth keeping

## What changes from v0

- **Visual chrome** entirely re-platformed onto Bootstrap 5 + Docsy `td-*` patterns to match opentelemetry.io
- **Light theme** added as the default (with dark + auto as toggle options)
- **Brand purple** introduced as `--color-secondary` and used for stats band, brand accents, breadcrumb active state
- **Stats** sourced from opentelemetry.io's canonical numbers
- **Signals** corrected to use `Baggage` instead of `Profiles`
- **CNCF incubating project** callout added to every page
- **Footer** restructured to two-cluster Font Awesome layout matching opentelemetry.io
- **Status pill mapping** locked to Bootstrap `text-bg-*` (success/info/warning/danger) for portability

## Direction: "The Catalog" — unchanged in spirit, re-skinned

The recommended direction remains "The Catalog" (treat the explorer like the npm/crates.io of OpenTelemetry — searchable, comparable, version-aware). The improvements borrowed from "Atlas" (pipeline diagrams) and "Dashboard" (version timeline + diff) are still in play. What's new is that all of it now lives inside the visual frame of opentelemetry.io.

## Page-by-page spec

### 1. Explorer home page

**Goal:** answer "what is this site, and what's in it?" in five seconds. Look unmistakably like a sub-page of opentelemetry.io.

**Layout (top to bottom):**
1. **Always-dark Docsy navbar** — Docs · Ecosystem (active) · Status · Community · Training · Blog · search · lang · theme toggle.
2. **Sub-nav** for the explorer (breadcrumb-only on the home page).
3. **Cover-block hero** — radial gradient + grid pattern background, OTel logo mark, "OpenTelemetry Ecosystem Explorer" gradient headline, lead copy, two CTAs (`btn-lg` primary orange + outline-light), and a glass-effect ⌘K-able global search input with chips.
4. **Stats band** (`box-primary`, OTel purple) — "12+ Languages · 200+ Collector Components · 1005+ Integrations · 102+ Vendors". Numbers link out to relevant pages, matching opentelemetry.io's pattern exactly.
5. **Ecosystems grid** — Collector and Java Agent as primary cards (with stability pill, count, latest version, "updated this week"), plus dashed "coming soon" cards for Python, Go, JS, .NET.
6. **Browse by signal** — four signal cards (Traces / Metrics / Logs / Baggage) matching opentelemetry.io's homepage.
7. **Recent activity** rail — last-30-days feed with status pills and ecosystem labels.
8. **CNCF callout** + Docsy footer.

**Why this beats the placeholder:** the visitor sees scale (canonical numbers) and recency above the fold, plus a global search. The page chrome is indistinguishable from opentelemetry.io.

### 2. Individual ecosystem landing

**Goal:** orient a user to *this* project, then send them to the list with sensible defaults.

**Layout:**
1. **Sub-nav with breadcrumbs**: `Explorer › Ecosystems › Collector`.
2. **Cover-block hero** — eyebrow, gradient title, description, three CTAs (Browse, Read overview, GitHub), and a "Latest release" card on the right with `+4 added · 12 changed · 2 deprecated` deltas.
3. **Pipeline anatomy** — five clickable stage cards (Receivers 98 → Processors 42 → Exporters 76 → Connectors 14 + Extensions 35), each as a one-click filter into the list. Color stripes on the indicator dots match the type-stripe taxonomy.
4. **Quick entry** — three cards (Most-used components · Core vs. Contrib · Diff across versions).
5. **CNCF + footer.**

### 3. List pages

**Goal:** make 200+ components actually browseable.

**Layout:**
- **Sub-nav with breadcrumbs.**
- **Page header**: gradient title, result count, view toggle (Cards / Compact / Table — Compact is default), sort dropdown.
- **Active filter chips** as Bootstrap `badge text-bg-secondary rounded-pill` with × dismiss.
- **Left-rail facets** (Bootstrap form): Search · Type (with color-stripe indicators) · Signal · Stability · Distribution (core/contrib) · Version. Each facet shows count alongside the label.
- **Compact result list** in a `.card` with grid rows: `[type-stripe | name + slug + description | type | signals | stability pill]`, alternating row backgrounds, sticky header, Bootstrap pagination footer.
- **URL-persisted filter state** (`?type=receiver&signal=traces&distribution=contrib`).

**Status-pill mapping (locked):** `stable=text-bg-success`, `beta=text-bg-info`, `alpha=text-bg-warning`, `unmaintained|deprecated=text-bg-danger`.

**Type stripe (4px left edge):** receiver=info-blue, processor=purple, exporter=orange, connector=pink, extension=teal.

### 4. Component detail page

**Goal:** be the canonical page for a component — overview, configuration, and what changed across versions.

**Layout (three-pane):**
- **Sub-nav with full breadcrumbs**: `Explorer › Collector › Receivers › Kafka Receiver`.
- **Left rail (sticky):** sibling navigator (98 receivers, with current highlighted in OTel orange) + on-page anchor links.
- **Center column:**
  - Header card with type stripe + eyebrow + title + slug + stability pill + version + signal badges + GitHub/Docs links.
  - **"Where this fits"** mini-pipeline diagram showing the component placed inside a typical pipeline.
  - Tabbed content area (Bootstrap `nav-tabs`): **Configuration** (Bootstrap striped table with Key/Type/Default/Description), **README**, **Emitted attributes**, **Examples**.
- **Right rail (sticky):**
  - **Version history timeline** — vertical timeline with current version highlighted in green, per-version changes summarized, with a `Compare` selector and a "Diff →" link.
  - **Compatibility card** — Min collector, Min Go, Distribution, License.

**Empty/error states:** spec four — *not yet released for this version*, *deprecated/removed*, *missing data*, *no docs yet*. Each gets a designed empty state, not a stack trace.

## Cross-cutting principles

1. **Continuity with opentelemetry.io is the spine.** Every component should look at home if dropped into the parent site.
2. **Light + dark parity.** No dark-only components. No light-only components. The theme toggle (persisted to `td-color-theme` in `localStorage`) flips both.
3. **Density toggles, not redesigns.** Every list view remembers the user's last density choice.
4. **URL is the state.** Every filter, sort, and tab is reflected in the URL so links are shareable.
5. **Status legibility before everything else.** Stability and distribution should be perceivable in <300ms scanning.
6. **One small diagram beats one paragraph.** Pipeline diagrams on the ecosystem landing and detail pages do more than 200 words of intro copy.
7. **Empty states are first-class.** "Component missing in this version" is information, not an error.
8. **CNCF on every page.** Non-negotiable — opentelemetry.io shows it everywhere and we need to match.

## Suggested sub-issues to break out of #84

If this lands well, the work splits naturally:

- [ ] Theme system — port to `data-bs-theme` with light/dark/auto, persist to `td-color-theme`, write contrast tests for both themes
- [ ] Navbar component — match opentelemetry.io structurally and visually; add explorer-specific sub-nav
- [ ] Footer component — Docsy two-cluster pattern with Font Awesome icons
- [ ] CNCF callout — reusable component on every route
- [ ] Stats band — fed from a single source of truth synced with the canonical numbers on opentelemetry.io
- [ ] Home page — hero (cover-block) + global search + recent activity
- [ ] Ecosystem landing — pipeline anatomy diagram (reusable component)
- [ ] List page — facet rail + density toggle + URL state + chip system
- [ ] Detail page layout — three-pane shell + sibling navigator
- [ ] Detail page — embedded README/config-table renderer (Bootstrap striped tables)
- [ ] Detail page — version timeline + diff view
- [ ] Status-pill / type-stripe mapping spec → already added to `DESIGN.md`
- [ ] Empty/error state library (4 patterns)

Each is small enough for one contributor to own.

## Mockup

A static, clickable HTML prototype with all four pages (Home / Ecosystem / List / Detail) and a top-bar switcher is included as `ecosystem-explorer-v1-mockups.html`. It uses Bootstrap 5 + Font Awesome (matching opentelemetry.io's stack) and supports the same theme toggle pattern. Open in a browser, click between the four tabs, and toggle the theme to see both modes.

## Open questions

- Should the explorer's home-page **search bar** actually search across ecosystems, or just be a launcher into per-ecosystem search?
- For the **detail page version diff**, do we have the underlying data (per-version config schemas, deprecation markers) in `ecosystem-registry`/`ecosystem-automation` already, or is that a data-pipeline prerequisite?
- Status terminology in the data is currently mixed (`alpha`/`beta`/`development`/`unmaintained`). Worth aligning to one taxonomy before locking pill colors.
- Will the explorer eventually live at `opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/explorer/` or as a separate domain? That decision affects how literally we mirror the navbar (sibling vs. linked-out).
